library for real-time system monitoring. Track CPU, memory, disk usage, network I/O, and more with ease.\nA Node.js package for monitoring system metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network interfaces, uptime, process information, and temperature. This package provides middleware for Express to gather and expose these system metrics in your web applications.\nTable of Contents\n\nSystem Monitor Package\nTable of Contents\nInstallation\nUsage\nBasic Usage\n\n\nAvailable Metrics\nExpress Middlewares\nMiddlewares\nError Tracking Middleware\nOverview\nCustomRequest Interface\ncreateErrorTrackingMiddleware Function\n\n\ntrackTime\nNotes\n\n\ntrackRequestResponseTime\n\n\nAPIs\nMiddlewares\nSome Response Examples\n\n\nOptions\nContributing\n\n\n\nInstallation\nYou can install this package using npm:\nExample :npm install system-monitoring\n## Or yarn add system-monitoringUsage\nBasic Usage\nTo use the system-monitoring functions in your project:\nExample :import { getCpuInfo, getMemoryUsage, getDiskUsage } from 'system-monitoring';\n\n// Get CPU information\ngetCpuInfo().then(cpuInfo => {\n  console.log('CPU Information:', cpuInfo);\n});\n\n// Get memory usage\ngetMemoryUsage().then(memoryUsage => {\n  console.log('Memory Usage:', memoryUsage);\n});\n\n// Get disk usage\nconst diskUsage = getDiskUsage();\nconsole.log('Disk Usage:', diskUsage);Available Metrics\nYou can retrieve the following system metrics using the provided functions:\n\nCPU Information: Get detailed CPU usage information for each core, including user/system/idle times and percentages.\nMemory Usage: Get total, free, and used memory statistics.\nDisk Usage: Get total, used, and available disk space.\nNetwork Interfaces: Get details about the system’s network interfaces.\nUptime: Get the system’s uptime in seconds.\nProcess Info: Get the CPU and memory usage of the current Node.js process.\nSystem Temperature: Get the current temperature of the system (if supported).\nLogs: Fetch system logs from a specific file with optional keyword filtering.\n\nExpress Middlewares\nThis package provides an Express middleware to gather and expose system metrics.\nExample :import express from 'express';\nimport { systemMonitor, trackRequestResponseTime, createErrorTrackingMiddleware } from 'system-monitoring';\n\nconst errorTrackingMiddleware: ReturnType = createErrorTrackingMiddleware();\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// Middleware to track response time\napp.use(trackRequestResponseTime()); // the time will append on the response header X-Response-Time\n\n// track error rate\napp.use(errorTrackingMiddleware) // access information by  req.errorResponse\n\n// System monitor middleware\napp.use(systemMonitor({ cpu: true, memory: true, disk: true })); // access information by req.systemMetrics\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('System monitoring active.');\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');\n});Middlewares\nError Tracking Middleware\nThis middleware tracks error statistics for your Express application by intercepting responses and recording error occurrences. It provides detailed insights into the total number of requests, error count, error rate, and the specific routes that are causing errors.\nOverview\n\nCustomRequest Interface: Extends the default Express Request object to include an optional errorResponse property for error statistics.\ncreateErrorTrackingMiddleware Function: Creates an error tracking middleware with isolated state for tracking errors in your Express application.\n\n\n\n\nOption\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntotalRequests\nnumber\n0\nThe total number of requests processed.\n\n\nerrorCount\nnumber\n0\nThe total number of error responses (status code 400 and above).\n\n\nerrorRate\nstring\n0.00%\nThe percentage of error responses relative to total requests.\n\n\nerrorRoutes\n{ [key: string]: number }\n{}\nAn object mapping routes to the number of errors encountered at each route.\n\n\n\nCustomRequest Interface\nThe CustomRequest interface extends the standard Express Request object to include an errorResponse property. This property is used to store error tracking information:\nExample :export interface CustomRequest extends Request {\n  errorResponse?: {\n    totalRequests: number;\n    errorCount: number;\n    errorRate: string;\n    errorRoutes: { [key: string]: number };\n  };\n}createErrorTrackingMiddleware Function\nThis factory function creates an Express middleware function that tracks error statistics. It maintains an in-memory state to count total requests, errors, and error rates. The middleware also tracks errors by route.\n\nUsage\n\n\nImport the Middleware: Import the createErrorTrackingMiddleware function into your Express application.\n\nExample :import { createErrorTrackingMiddleware } from 'system-monitoring';\nAdd Middleware to Your Application: Use the middleware in your Express application.\n\nExample :const app = express();\napp.use(createErrorTrackingMiddleware());\nAccess Error Statistics: You can access error statistics via the errorResponse property on the req object within your route handlers or other middleware.\n\nExample :app.get('/some-route', (req: CustomRequest, res: Response) => {\n  // Access error statistics\n  const errorStats = req.errorResponse;\n  console.log('Error Statistics:', errorStats);\n  \n  res.send('Response body');\n});\nNote: Future adding, will add appility to adding on file or db like trackTime\n\ntrackTime\ntrackTime is a middleware function for Express.js that tracks the response time for each request and provides the ability to log the data either to a file or to a database via a callback function.\n\nImport the middleware into your Express app.\nYou can configure trackTime to log the response times to a file, send them to a database, or both.\n\nExample Code\nExample :import express from 'express';\nimport { trackTime } from './middlewares/trackTime';\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// Example database storage function (optional)\nfunction storeOnDb(logData: { method: string; url: string; responseTime: string; timestamp: string }) {\n  // Simulate storing in a database (replace this with your actual DB logic)\n  console.log('Storing log in the database:', logData);\n}\n\n// Use the middleware to track request/response time\napp.use(trackTime({\n  filePath: './logs/request_logs.txt', // Optional: Logs to a file\n  storeOnDb: storeOnDb                 // Optional: Callback to store logs in a database\n}));\n\n// Example route\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello, World!');\n});\n\n// Start the server\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');\n});Track Time Middleware Options\nYou can configure the behavior of the trackTime middleware by passing an options object with the following properties:\n\n\n\nOption\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfilePath\nstring (optional)\nThe path where logs will be written. If provided, the middleware will log each request to this file in JSON format.\n\n\nstoreOnDb\n(logData: LogData) => void (optional)\nA callback function that receives the log data for storing in a database. This function will be called every time a request finishes.\n\n\n\nLog Data Structure\nThe log data passed to the file or the storeOnDb function will have the following structure:\nExample :interface LogData {\n  method: string;       // HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST)\n  url: string;          // The URL requested\n  responseTime: string; // Time taken to process the request in milliseconds\n  timestamp: string;    // ISO timestamp when the request was made\n}Logging Options\n\nLogging to a File: If you provide the filePath option, the logs will be written to the specified file in JSON format. Each log entry will be appended to the file on a new line.\nExample log entry:\n\nExample :{\"method\":\"GET\",\"url\":\"/\",\"responseTime\":\"12.345\",\"timestamp\":\"2024-09-15T10:30:00.123Z\"}\nStoring in a Database: If you pass a storeOnDb callback function, it will be called with the log data. You can implement your own logic to store this data in a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL).\n\nExample of Custom Database Storage Function\nExample :// Example function to store log data in a MongoDB database\nimport { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';\n\nasync function storeLogInDb(logData: LogData) {\n  const client = await MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017');\n  const db = client.db('logsDatabase');\n  await db.collection('requestLogs').insertOne(logData);\n  await client.close();\n}\n\n// Pass this function to the `trackTime` middleware\napp.use(trackTime({ storeOnDb: storeLogInDb }));Notes\n\nFile Path: Ensure that the file path exists or is writable by your application. If the path does not exist, the middleware will automatically create the directory.\nPerformance Considerations: If you log data to a file or database on every request, ensure your storage mechanism can handle the load without affecting performance.\n\ntrackRequestResponseTime\n// will write docs here\nAPIs\nSystem Monitoring Functions\n\ngetCpuInfo(): Returns CPU usage details for all cores and the system as a whole.\ngetMemoryUsage(): Retrieves total, free, and used memory information.\ngetDiskUsage(): Fetches disk usage statistics including total, used, and available space.\ngetNetworkInfo(): Returns details about all network interfaces.\ngetSystemUptime(): Returns the system uptime in seconds.\ngetProcessInfo(): Provides the CPU and memory usage of the current process.\ngetOSInfo: Retrieves detailed information about the operating system.\ngetLoadAverage: Retrieves the system load averages over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.\ngetUserInfo: Retrieves extended user information and system details.\ngetTemperature(): Returns the system temperature (if supported).\ngetFileSystemInfo: Retrieves information about the file system, including disk space usage.\ngetActiveConnections: Retrieves the active network connections on the system.\ngetScheduledTasks: Retrieves a list of scheduled tasks from the system and parses them into an object.\ngetServiceStatus: Retrieves the status of a given service.\ngetLogs(path, keyword): Fetches logs from the specified file, optionally filtering by a keyword.\n\nMiddlewares\n\nsystemMonitor: System monitor middleware for gathering system metrics.\ntrackTime: Middleware to track request/response time.
